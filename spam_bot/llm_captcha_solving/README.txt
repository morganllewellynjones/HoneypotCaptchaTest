This directory does not consist of functional code. This includes specific code snippets acquired by chatGPT in a conversation to create a program that can bypass our riddle CAPTCHAs. The advancement of the LLM is immediately clear. If asked to solve our puzzles, chatGPT can create a program that could do so in seconds with very little trouble. This means that our homegrown CAPTCHA is not secure against a targeted attack, but it might be secure against a general bot that has no idea that one of the form fields is a CAPTCHA riddle.
